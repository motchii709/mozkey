- Notes: Distributed without modification except for file placement, file naming, and packaging into the MSI installer. Used as the llama-server speculative decoding draft model; shares the GPT-2 architecture and 6000-token GPT-2 BPE tokenizer (tokenizer.ggml.pre=gpt2-small-japanese-char) with the Zenz v3.2 small target model, so draft tokens are verified losslessly.

## Privacy note

Zenz live correction is designed to run locally. The bundled runtime is started as a local process and the HTTP inference endpoint is expected to bind to 127.0.0.1 only. User input is not intentionally sent to external servers by this feature.
Zenz feedback learning can be disabled in the settings UI. Left context is sanitized before being included in prompts; sensitive-looking context such as URLs, email addresses, file paths, tokens, and long numeric identifiers is rejected before prompt construction.
