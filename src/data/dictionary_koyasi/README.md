# Koyasi Dictionary Data

This directory contains additional dictionary data and generated dictionary artifacts for this Mozc fork.

## Policy

- Do not edit upstream dictionary files directly when possible.
- Generated dictionary files are not committed by default.
- External dictionaries must be imported through scripts.
- Large dictionaries should be separated by profile, such as `sample`, `daily`, `rich`, and `max`.
- The default committed Bazel profile should remain `sample` because `daily`, `rich`, and `max` depend on locally generated files.
- When adding a new external dictionary source, document its upstream URL, license note, generated output path, and whether the generated artifact is committed.

## External dictionary sources and licenses

This directory uses external dictionary sources during local generation.

Generated dictionary files are not committed by default. Before redistributing a built package that includes generated dictionaries, check the upstream source licenses, attribution requirements, and any distribution notes.

Current external sources used by the daily workflow:

| Source | Used for | Upstream / license note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `merge-ut-dictionaries` | merge-ut daily profile | Upstream generated dictionary is described as `Combined`. Check the upstream LICENSE and source-specific license notes before redistribution. |
| `dic-nico-intersection-pixiv` | nico/pixiv delta dictionary | Upstream states that the code is MIT licensed and that the generated dictionary data is published with no copyright claim by the upstream author. Treat redistribution as review-required because the data is derived from external web sources. |
| `mozcdic-ut-personal-names` | personal names dictionary | Upstream is Apache License, Version 2.0. Check upstream attribution and NOTICE requirements before redistribution. |
| `dwyl/english-words` | curated English word list (`src/data/dictionary_manual/english_words.tsv`) | Upstream `LICENSE.md` is the verbatim Unlicense public-domain dedication. Source file `words_alpha.txt` (<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt>, sha256 `3ed0c94610d8bcf7c11bbb49c56aa49c7234d32b66824df91f554169e572da48`, retrieved 2026-10-10 UTC). Upstream `word_list_moby_credits.txt` records that the list is the Moby Word Lists by Grady Ward, Project Gutenberg eBook 3201, "Public domain in the USA"; upstream `README.md` also points at an infochimps "simple english words" dataset. The generated TSV is committed; regenerate it with `python tools/dictionary/generate_english_words.py`. |

Repository policy:

- Commit import/conversion scripts, BUILD files, documentation, and small tracked samples.
- Do not commit downloaded external dictionary archives.
- Do not commit large generated dictionary artifacts under `generated/` or `dist/`.
- Recheck upstream license notes when changing source dictionaries or redistribution policy.

## Generated files

`generated/` is ignored by Git. Run import and preparation scripts to regenerate files locally.

Main generated files:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/mozcdic-ut-safe.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/mozcdic-ut-rich.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/personal_names/mozcdic-ut-personal-names.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/personal_names/mozcdic-ut-personal-names.txt.bz2
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-daily.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-rich.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/dic-nico-pixiv-delta.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-personal-names-daily.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt
```

These generated dictionary files are created locally and are not committed.

The syntax guard dictionary is generated from:

```text
tools/dictionary/generate_syntax_guard_dictionary.py
```

Do not maintain a hand-written `src/data/dictionary_koyasi/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt`. The daily Bazel target uses:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt
```

## Notes for Windows PowerShell

Generated dictionary files are UTF-8. Use `-Encoding UTF8` when inspecting them with PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Content -Encoding UTF8 src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/mozcdic-ut-safe.txt -TotalCount 10
Get-Content -Encoding UTF8 src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt -TotalCount 30
```

## Daily dictionary preparation workflow

The recommended way to prepare the enhanced daily dictionary is:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1
```

If external source dictionaries have already been downloaded, use:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1 -SkipDownload
```

This script performs the following steps:

1. Import merge-ut source dictionaries.
2. Import `dic-nico-intersection-pixiv`.
3. Import `mozcdic-ut-personal-names`.
4. Generate the merge-ut daily profile.
5. Convert the nico/pixiv delta dictionary.
6. Profile the personal names dictionary.
7. Check the daily profile.
8. Generate the syntax guard dictionary.
9. Switch the active local dictionary profile to `daily`.

The daily local dictionary target currently consists of:

```text
generated/profiled/dic-nico-pixiv-delta.txt
generated/profiled/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt
generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-daily.txt
generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-personal-names-daily.txt
```

After preparing the daily dictionary, build Mozc from `src/`:

```powershell
cd src
bazelisk build --config oss_windows --config release_build //data/dictionary_oss:dictionary_data
bazelisk build --config oss_windows --config release_build package
python build_tools/open.py bazel-bin/win32/installer/Mozc64.msi
cd ..
```

Before committing unrelated work, return to the tracked sample profile:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\use_merge_ut_profile.ps1 -Profile sample
```

Then confirm:

```powershell
git status --short
```

`src/data/dictionary_oss/BUILD.bazel` should not appear unless you intentionally changed it.

## Merge-UT dictionary workflow

`merge-ut-dictionaries` is used as a source for large external dictionary data.

### Generate merge-ut source dictionaries

Sample profile:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\import_merge_ut.ps1 -Profile sample -SampleLines 5000
```

Rich profile:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\import_merge_ut.ps1 -Profile rich -SampleLines 5000
```

Generated files are written under:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/
```

### Generate profiled dictionaries

Daily profile:

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/profile_merge_ut.py --profile daily
```

Rich profile:

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/profile_merge_ut.py --profile rich
```

Profiled files are written under:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/
```

### Check profiled dictionaries

Daily profile check:

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/check_merge_ut_profile.py --profile daily
```

The positive checks must pass. Watch keys are informational and are used to inspect potentially risky readings.

### Switch the active merge-ut profile

Use the tracked sample dictionary:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\use_merge_ut_profile.ps1 -Profile sample
```

Use the locally generated daily dictionary:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\use_merge_ut_profile.ps1 -Profile daily
```

The default committed state should use `sample`, because `daily`, `rich`, and `max` dictionaries are locally generated and are not committed.

## Nico/Pixiv dictionary workflow

`dic-nico-intersection-pixiv` is imported as an additional delta dictionary for the daily local profile.

The generated delta is compared against the generated daily dictionary and the base Mozc dictionaries. Existing key/value pairs are skipped.

The nico/pixiv converter applies a tiered cost policy. Compact modern compounds such as `ママ活` are intentionally stronger than general long-tail proper nouns, while phrase-like or punctuation-heavy entries are kept weaker.

Entries whose values end with decorative symbols such as `☆`, `★`, `♡`, `♪`, or `※` are rejected because they tend to be noisy candidate forms in daily conversion.

### Download source dictionary

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\import_nico_pixiv.ps1
```

### Convert to Mozc system dictionary delta

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/convert_nico_pixiv.py
```

The generated file is:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/dic-nico-pixiv-delta.txt
```

This file is ignored by Git.

### Build daily with Nico/Pixiv delta

The recommended daily workflow already includes nico/pixiv delta conversion:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1
```

If source dictionaries are already available locally:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1 -SkipDownload
```

## Personal names dictionary workflow

`mozcdic-ut-personal-names` is imported as an additional weak personal-name dictionary for the daily local profile.

The generated personal-name dictionary is compared against:

- the generated merge-ut daily dictionary
- the nico/pixiv delta dictionary
- the base Mozc dictionaries

Existing key/value pairs are skipped.

The personal names profiler uses Mozc personal-name POS IDs. Full-name-like entries are emitted with `名詞,固有名詞,人名,姓` as the left ID and `名詞,固有名詞,人名,名` as the right ID, while other entries use `名詞,固有名詞,人名,一般`. The base cost is intentionally weak, and risky short readings, long katakana-like names, group-like names, ASCII values, punctuation-heavy values, and hiragana-only same key/value entries are filtered or demoted.

### Download source dictionary

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\import_personal_names.ps1
```

If the source archive already exists locally:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\import_personal_names.ps1 -SkipDownload
```

### Profile personal names for daily use

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/profile_personal_names.py
```

The generated file is:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-personal-names-daily.txt
```

This file is ignored by Git.

### Build daily with personal names

The recommended daily workflow already includes personal-name import and profiling:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1
```

If source dictionaries are already available locally:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1 -SkipDownload
```

## Syntax guard dictionary

`koyasi-syntax-guard.txt` is a small generated dictionary used to protect high-impact grammar-like conversion paths from bad segmentation.

It is intentionally conservative. It is not a broad automatic prefix dictionary.

Examples of guarded paths:

```text
とうちたい       と打ちたい
とうちたいのに   と打ちたいのに
にわける         に分ける
のに             のに
にまで           にまで
までに           までに
までも           までも
はだみはなさず   肌身離さず
```

The syntax guard dictionary is generated by:

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/generate_syntax_guard_dictionary.py
```

The output file is:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt
```

A debug TSV is also written to:

```text
dist/dictionary/koyasi-syntax-guard-debug.tsv
```

The guard dictionary should remain small. Avoid broad generated prefix entries that produce many unrelated candidates such as `と + 固有名詞`.

Current guard generation has four layers:

1. Collision-driven guards generated from suspicious base-dictionary collision candidates.
2. Fixed function phrase guards such as `のに`, `には`, `にまで`, `までに`, `までも`, `では`, `として`, and `について`.
3. A very small set of seeded guards for observed high-impact segmentation failures.
4. A tiny set of direct idiom guards for fixed expressions such as `肌身離さず`.

Direct idiom guards should be rare. They are used only when the expression is fixed, common enough to matter, and hard to reproduce reliably from component entries.

Seeded guards are acceptable only when all of the following are true:

- The bad conversion has been observed in real use.
- The correct conversion is unambiguous.
- The guard is likely to help common daily input.
- The number of generated guard entries remains very small.
- The guard does not broadly suppress normal dictionary behavior.

Do not use the suffix collision scanner output as a demotion list. It is diagnostic only.

## General vocabulary evaluation

General vocabulary coverage is evaluated separately from the large external
dictionary workflows above.

The evaluation strategy and reusable validation workflow are documented in:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/evaluation/general_vocab/README.md
```


## Diagnostic tools

Use the following tool to inspect which dictionary contains a specific entry:

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/find_dictionary_entries.py --key とうちたい
python tools/dictionary/find_dictionary_entries.py --value 統治体
python tools/dictionary/find_dictionary_entries.py --key ままかつ
python tools/dictionary/find_dictionary_entries.py --key にわける
```

Use the following tool to scan possible suffix collision candidates:

```powershell
python tools/dictionary/scan_suffix_collision_candidates.py --max-cost 8500 --limit 120
```

The suffix collision scanner is diagnostic only. Its output should not be blindly demoted because many valid daily words can match the same suffix patterns.

## Build profiles

### `sample`

Tracked, small, and safe for committed Bazel state.

Use this before committing unrelated work:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\use_merge_ut_profile.ps1 -Profile sample
```

### `daily`

Locally generated enhanced dictionary for daily use.

It currently combines:

- merge-ut daily profile
- nico/pixiv delta dictionary
- personal names dictionary
- syntax guard dictionary

Prepare it with:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1
```

Or, when sources are already available:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\prepare_daily_dictionary.ps1 -SkipDownload
```

### `rich`

Recall-oriented profile generated from a larger merge-ut source set. This is useful for experiments but is not the default daily profile.

## Commit policy

Commit scripts, BUILD files, documentation, and small tracked samples.

Do not commit large generated dictionaries under:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/
dist/
```

Do not commit generated profiled daily dictionary files such as:

```text
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/dic-nico-pixiv-delta.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-daily.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/mozcdic-ut-personal-names-daily.txt
src/data/dictionary_koyasi/generated/profiled/koyasi-syntax-guard.txt
```

Before committing, verify:

```powershell
.\tools\dictionary\use_merge_ut_profile.ps1 -Profile sample
git status --short
```

`src/data/dictionary_oss/BUILD.bazel` should not appear unless the intended committed state has changed.
